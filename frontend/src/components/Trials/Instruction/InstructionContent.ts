        "Good choice! There will be four rounds in which you can learn from the selected player.",

Afterwards, you can read the selected player’s description of their solution and you will  see a full replay of it. Finally, you will navigate the network again by yourself. As these rounds are still for you to learn, the points will again not count towards your bonus payment; but you should still try to maximise them."],

    demonstration: [
        "Well done! Now you will play two final rounds that serve as demonstrations for future players to learn from. You will not earn points directly, but the second half of your bonus payment depends on the performance of people that learn from you, so try your best!"],
